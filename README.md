Every time the Hang In There website is loaded, the main page will randomly generate a new poster (image, title and quote). The user has the ability to randomly generate another poster by clicking the **Show Another Random Poster** button. 

Select the **Make Your Own Poster** button to fill out a form to create a poster from scratch. An image url, title and quote **all have to be entered** before the **Show my poster** button will work. ![hangInThere2](./readme-imgs/hangInThere2.png)To return to the main page, without completely filling out the form, click the **Nevermind, take Mel back!** button. To save the newly created poster click the **Save This Poster** button. 

The user has the ability to save their unique posters and randomly generated posters. **Show Saved Posters** will display all of the posters that have been saved. To removed saved posters double click anywhere on the poster to no longer have it included on this page.
